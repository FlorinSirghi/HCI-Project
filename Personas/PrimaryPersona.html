                <p> Remus is a software engineer working for Microsoft on their well-known operating system, Windows. He developed a
                    passion for computers ever since he was a kid when he was playing video games. </p>
                <p> He enjoyed shooter games the most,
                    because they were pretty straight-forward : kill the enemy to win the game and they didn't have too many rules, as
                    he was spending his time learning for school and he didn't want to spend anymore time on reading a lot of rules or
                    familiarizing himself with complex mechanics, but the lack of realism in these games frustrated him : when he was
                    shooting his gun he thought that the recoil is too big, the movement didn't feel natural and there were a lot of
                    cheaters.</p>
                <p> In his free time now, Remus enjoys spending time in nature by himself or with his friends, playing board games or
                    having a meal.</p>
                <p> During a workshop at the company about physical health he realized that he
                    sits a lot in front of his computer to work and also this might be the reason for his back pain and that he needs
                    some physical activity in his life to compesate for
                    this. The workshop also encouraged the participants to do some introspection and try to align the activities they
                    might do with their personality traits or other things they would like in their life. Thus, when Remus thought of
                    activities he might do he realized that he has a competitive spirit and that he needs to improve his communication
                    skills
                    to be able to work in a team better. </p>

            <p class="subsection-header"><strong>Scenarios</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>when Remus is playing airsoft and he is not quite sure if he saw someone or not, he uses the simple radar from the app which
                    shows if there was someone detected in his sight or not</li>
                <li>
                    if his friends are not available to play in the day Remus wants to he uses the app's matchmaker to find other people to play with
                </li>
                <li>if he is not quite sure where he is during the match, he can use the apps' map to guide himself around</li>
