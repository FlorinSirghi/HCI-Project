                <p> Paul is a fitness trainer at Oxygen, during his work he helps people understand how to do the exercises
                    correctly and how to use the various machines in the gym. He also prepares meal plans and fitness plans for his
                    clients. His favourite thing to do in the gym is running on the treadmill training for speed and endurance.</p>
                <p> At the gym, Paul is well known for his focus on doing the exercises with correct form. He never cuts corners or ego
                    lifts just to prove that he is "strong". He always gives constructive criticism to his clients and never tries to
                    lie to them just to make them fell better.</p>
                <p> Before being a fitness trainer, Paul was a darts referee, he enjoyed both playing and watching, especially observing
                    infractions and ensuring adherence to the rules. Due to his trustworthy nature, he was very succesfull and was often
                    called to referee darts matches not only in his city but also all around the country. However the lack of physical
                    activity required for this job made him quit as it didn't quite align with his passions.</p>
                <p> Lately, the owner of Oxygen gym started to replace the old equipment with newer things. The new equipment is based
                    on newer technology discovered in fitness and so it requires a higher technology level to be able to use it
                    correctly. This comes as a challenge to Paul as he was never a "tech" guy. Nevertheless, this will not stop him to
                    fulfill his passion for fitness.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>when Paul is refereeing the game, he can look at the game lobby to see who was shot and and then at the map to
                    quickly check if they stopped shooting</li>
                <li>using the app Paul can quickly pull up the rule book and easily enforce these rules on the players</li>
                <li>Paul can see reviews and evaluation from the players to improve his refereeing skills </li>
