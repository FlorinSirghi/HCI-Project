                <p> Rodica is a financial advisor at Raiffeisen Bank. She was always passionate about business such that she tried
                    opening multiple businesses in her life, some of which worked and some did not. While running her businesses she got
                    a lot of experience in the finance and technology and she always looked to innovate her work.</p>
                <p> Most of the businesses Rodica ran were related to the field of IT. She always tried to make sure that the apps her
                    company develops have an intuitive interface as he often found that this is a problem, especially for banking apps.
                    Another point of focus in her work was to make sure that the apps are secure, since she has a passion for cyber
                    security. She treated this with great respect as she was aware of the risks involved when handling user data. </p>
                <p> This period of her life had immensely contributed to Rodica's developed as a person. She became very good at working
                    under pressure, especially when her business wasn't doing good and she developed her communication skills. However
                    one thing she didn't manage to overcome yet is her impatience, both with herself and with others.</p>
                <p> One problem that arrived as of late is finding another activity outside of her financial work. She feels like she
                    wants to take on a new challenge but she doesn't have any idea what could that be. </p>
